# Military Base Jobs

MilitaryBaseJobs.com uses Laravel 5.2 and the USAJobs.gov API to create a niche job board website that is specific to federal government jobs on or near military bases. These kinds of positions are sought out by military, veteran, spouse, and civilian job seekers alike.

This is a work in progress.
